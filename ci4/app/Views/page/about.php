        <p>
        The core team of MIT engineers has been working together since 200X when they built the RapidFire technology prior to the acquisition by Agilent in 2011. The team then provided RapidFire services through Agilent Discovery Services and in 2015 PureHoney Technologies. Since then, the team has provided top-quality MS solutions to their client’s toughest assays and discovery needs. <br><br>
        Momentum Biotechnologies specializes in RNA—both as a target and a therapeutic. For RNA targets, we offer solution phase Affinity Selection Mass Spectrometry, structure activity relationship assays, and hit expansion with proprietary computational software. For RNA therapeutics, we provide extensive lipid nanoparticle characterization that can be connected to functional effects through our biomarker quantitation services. Beyond RNA, we offer lead identification services for novel mechanisms of action like protein degradation and protein-protein interaction interruption (ASMS) and irreversible binding (Covalent Screening). Momentum can additionally support Cell and Gene Therapy applications through ICP-MS analysis of trace metals and viral vector characterization services. <br><br>
        As engineers, our goal is to accelerate the design-build-test cycle for your therapeutic. We pride ourselves on rapid turnaround of the highest quality data, maintaining the momentum of our clients’ projects.
