                <h3 class="service-name">Affinity Selection Mass Spectrometry (“ASMS”)  </h3>
                <div class="service-desc">
                    We specialize in high throughput affinity selection mass spectrometry (“ASMS”) screens using the Auto-mated Ligand Identification System (“ALIS”) on an Agilent 2D-HPLC system interfaced to an Agilent Time-of-Flight MS. <br><br>
                    ASMS offers several distinct advantages over legacy high throughput screening (“HTS”) methods: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ASMS is binding site agnostic, enabling clients to identify potential leads acting through a variety of mechanisms, including degradation and disruption of protein-protein or protein-oligonucleotide in-teractions. </li>
                        <li>ASMS is compatible with a range of targets. Protein, RNA, and Protein Complexes can be screened without the need for tagging or surface immobilization, ensuring the results are physiolog-ically relevant. </li>
                        <li>ASMS requires very little target (~1mg) to screen hundreds of thousands of potential compounds.</li>
                        <li>ASMS assay development is limited to buffer optimization and therefore much faster than tradition-al biochemical HTS methods like FRET and enzymatic assays, enabling identification of leads in half the time. </li>
                        <li>ASMS is much faster to run than other biophysical assays such as SPR, interferometry, DSF, Mesoscale, ITC, and NMR.</li>
                        <li>ASMS allows compounds to be screened in pools of 250: 100,000 test compounds can be screened in a single day.</li>
                        <li>ASMS covers broad chemical space as positive mode electrospray ionization is compatible with 95% of drug-like test compounds.</li>
                        <li>ASMS is immune to false positives resulting from active impurities and breakdown products by identifying the exact compound based on molecular formula. </li>
                    </ul>
                    We have extensive experience using ASMS screens to study hundreds of targets tested against tens of millions of compounds. <br><br>
                    We can screen third-party and internal client libraries. While we typically screen Rule of Five compliant chemical libraries, we can also screen macrocyclics. We offer target QC on proteins and RNA to ensure accurate screens. <br><br>
                    Following ASMS primary, pooled screens: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We recommend clients run a secondary screen to confirm hits in small pools of one to five compounds.</li>
                        <li>We can also rank order hits by competitive binding, give quantitative information on target occupancy, and determine binding affinity for SAR studies. </li>
                    </ul>
                    Next day data delivery may be possible with couriered samples to our Billerica location, which is only a half hour outside of Cambridge.

                    Our team developed a covalent binding assay that enables screening of electrophilic test compounds that irreversibly modify protein targets on a RapidFire coupled to an Agilent Quadrupole Time-of-Flight MS. <br>

                    We offer ICP-MS analysis for several applications depending on the needs of our clients’ specific programs. We have used ICP-MS to test for trace metals in CGT and biologics media, perform pharmacokinetic stud-ies on metallodrugs, quantify biomarkers for rare diseases (Ex. Wilson’s Disease), and characterize zinc finger proteins. <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We understand that ICP-MS results are crucial to go-forward decision making in CGT and biologics de-velopment, so we strive to turn around data as fast as possible. We can analyze hundreds of samples daily. </li>
