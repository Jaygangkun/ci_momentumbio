                    Momentum Biotechnologies specializes in high throughput affinity selection mass spectrometry (ASMS) screens using the Automated Ligand Identification System (ALIS). ALIS/ASMS offers several distinct advantages over legacy HTS methods:<br><br>
                     • ALIS/ASMS is binding site agnostic, enabling clients to identify potential leads acting through a variety of mechanisms, including degradation and interruption of protein-protein or protein-oligonucletide interactions.<br>
                      • ALIS/ASMS is compatible with a range of targets. Protein, RNA, and Protein Complexes can be screened without the need for tagging or surface immobilization, ensuring the results are physiologically relevant.<br> 
                      • ALIS/ASMS requires very little target (~1mg) to screen hundreds of thousands of potential compounds.<br>
                      • ALIS/ASMS is much faster to set up than other HTS methods like FRET or enzymatic assays, enabling you to identify leads in half the time.<br>
                      • ALIS/ASMS allows compounds to be pooled in wells of 280? (whatever number we want the price expectation to be for) saving clients time and money: 100k test compounds can be screened in a single day.<br><br>
                      • ALIS/ASMS covers broad chemical space as positive mode electrospray ionization is compatible with 95% of drug-like test compounds.<br> Momentum Biotechnologies has extensive experience using ALIS/ASMS screens to study X targets tested against 10^X compounds (cumulatively would be fun because it’s a massive number).<br><br>
                       In addition to screening our in-house library of XXX compounds or a client’s library, we can arrange access to the Wuxi Apptec library of 300k compounds and the Charles River Laboratories library of 700k compounds. For clients bringing their own library, we have experience in screening macrocyclic peptide libraries in addition to our expertise in small molecules.<br><br>
                        Following ALIS/ASMS primary, pooled screens:<br>
                        • We recommend clients run a follow up screen to confirm hits in single wells.<br>
                        • We can also rank order your hits by competitive binding, give quantitative information on target occupancy, and determine binding affinity for SAR studies.<br>
                        • For protein targets, we can determine the compound binding site with hydrogen deuterium exchange.<br>
                        • We can perform virtual hit expansion, ensuring no chemical space goes unexplored to deliver the best lead to our clients.  Same day data delivery may be possible with courier delivered samples to our Billerica location only a half hour from downtown Boston/Cambridge.

                Momentum Biotechnologies offers ICP-MS analysis for several applications depending on the needs of your specific program. In addition to routine testing for trace metals in CGT and biologics growth media, Momentum has also used ICP-MS to quantify biomarkers of response for rare diseases (Ex. Wilson’s Disease) and to optimize lipid nanoparticles using a metal biomarker model system.<br><br>
                We understand that ICP-MS results are crucial to go-forward decision making in CGT and biologics development, so we strive to turn around data as fast as possible.
